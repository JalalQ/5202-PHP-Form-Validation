# Introduction

In this project I implementd a minimum-viable-product form submission, which was validated using PHP functions. 
- [x] Any correctly entered value was stored in the field box, so that the user does not need to enter a correct value previously entered.
- [x] Form validation is performed with the help of regex validation.
- [x] When the user enters invalid information, useful feedback information is provided to the user to enter valid information.
- [x] Once all the field values have been correctly entered, user is shown a welcome message in green color.
